__Testing Architecture__
Framework Used - POM and Data Driven Testing Frame work 
__POM Structure:__
1. Pages-> Under pages the elements are located and values are passed.
2. Test-> Test logic is done here. Read the data set from the spreadsheet(external file) and passed to the elements.
3. Utility -> Reading and Writing to the spreadhseet
4. Report -> HTML report generated is storeed here 
5. Screenshot-> To store the screenshots taken while test runs
__Data Driven Testing Framework:__
1. Hardcoding is avoided
2. Stored the test data's in spreadsheet(Open Office) apart from the functions.
Note:
1. The ODS files may not be readable, so I have uploaded images of those sheets here.

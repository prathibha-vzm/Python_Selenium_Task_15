Testing Architecture
Framework Used - POM and Data Driven Testing Frame work 
POM Structure:
Pages-> Under pages the elements are located and values are passed.
Test-> Test logic is done here. Read the data set from the spreadsheet(external file) and passed to the elements.
Utility -> Reading and Writing to the spreadhseet
Report -> HTML report generated is storeed here 
Screenshot-> To store the screenshots taken while test runs
Data Driven Testing Framework:
Hardcoding is avoided
Stored the test data's in spreadsheet(Open Office) apart from the functions.
Note:
The ODS files may not be readable, so I have uploaded images of those sheets here.
